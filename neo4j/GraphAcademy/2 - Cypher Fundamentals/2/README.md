# Writing Data to Neo4j

In this module you will learn how to update the graph using Cypher and the Movies example dataset.

Summary:

- Use `MERGE` to create nodes in the graph.
- Use `MERGE` to create relationships in the graph.
- Create, update and remove properties for nodes and relationships in the graph.
- Perform conditional `MERGE` processing, depending on what is in the graph.
- Delete nodes and relationships from the graph.
